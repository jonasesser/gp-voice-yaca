This is the original yaca altv resource migrated to a athena framework resource. I created it as first step for my gp-voice plugin. You can use it without gp-voice. gp-voice has a different yacar implementation!

Development in progress. Its not functional, yet!

This plugin is for my customized Athena Framework core called "gp-core", available on my discord for contributors.
